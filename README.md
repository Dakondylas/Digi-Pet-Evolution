Digital Pet Evolution



Description

Digital Pet Evolution is a fun, interactive simulation game where you adopt and take care of a virtual pet that evolves over time. As you feed, play, sleep, and teach your pet, its stats such as hunger, happiness, energy, and intelligence will change. The pet can evolve into different stages based on its age, stats, and personality. The game allows for a dynamic experience where the pet's traits, behavior, and appearance are influenced by the actions you take.


The game is designed to mimic a pet care simulation, where your goal is to raise a pet, manage its needs, and watch it grow and evolve through four distinct evolutionary paths: Warrior, Scholar, Mystic, and Jester.

Evolution Stages: Your pet evolves into different forms based on its stats and age. It can evolve into a Warrior, Scholar, Mystic, or Jester.


Stats Tracking: Keep track of your pet's hunger, happiness, energy, and intelligence using progress bars. Each action you take affects these stats.


Random Personality Changes: Based on your pet's actions and the stats, the pet can develop different personalities (e.g., Curious, Energetic, Friendly, etc.).
