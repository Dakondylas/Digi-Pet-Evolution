Digital Pet Evolution


What did you build?


I made a digital pet raising simulator where you raise a pet from an egg to an adult and beyond.


What language(s) or tools did you use?


I programmed in java using java Intellij


Which AI tools did you use, and how?


I used claude and chatGPT. I used Claude until I ran out of stuff to ask it. Then I swapped over to chatGPT which gave me all it's free answers too then downgraded me to a worse version. I used claude to come up with ideas and make the base code for the game. I argued with chatGPT over why the code was not working


What did you do versus what AI helped with?


I added a single function that makes the game full screen when the game starts up. Claude did the rest. Claude went too into the weeds with creating seperate windows and formatting that I was not familiar with and I definitely should have told claude to dial it back probably just to the console


What’s one thing you’re proud of?


Absolutely nothing, I made one full screen function that isn't even called with F11 (spent over an hour trying to implament) and so the rest of the work is just the work of claude


What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?


I don't use AI in coding (seriously) so I need to make sure that I remember to tell it if it goes out of scope
